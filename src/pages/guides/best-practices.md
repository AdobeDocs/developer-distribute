# Benefits and Best Practices

## Benefits of Listing in Our Marketplace

1. Millions of Creative Cloud users will have direct access to your plugin(s) through the Creative Cloud desktop app or the Adobe Exchange webpage.

2. Easy, one click installation; installation is handled by the Creative Cloud desktop app.

3. Plugin acquisition is tied to an Adobe ID. Users may easily reinstall your plugin on a new machine or on alternative hardware.

4. Users are automatically notified of plugin updates and installing updates is easy. 

5. With developer profiles, users can easily find all of your plugins on one page. 

6. An easy monetization opportunity built in. Adobe uses [FastSpring](https://fastspring.com/sign-up/payee-adobe/) for the handling of payments.

7. Users can trust that plugins listed on the Marketplace are both secure and useable, because they have gone through a formal review process.

8. You may use our official "Designed for" badges to promote your plugin.

9. Additional Support is available to users for installation issues.

## Best Practices

#### Use the same developer Adobe ID for both UXP and CEP plugins

You should always use the same Adobe ID to submit CEP and UXP plugins. This makes it easier to track plugin performance, manage your listings, and respond to user comments.

#### Proper Description

Use the description field to explain what your plugin can do, what its features and functionality are, and what can be achieved using the plugin. It is very beneficial for end users if you provide a video that captures plugin functionality so that new users get a better understanding of how to use your plugin.

#### Update Your Plugin(s) Regularly

Updating your plugin(s) on a regular basis to make it compatible with the latest version of the supported point product. Updating you plugin(s) will provide an awesome and seamless experience for the end user which will reflect on your revenue and ratings.

#### Share Test Credentials

Always share test credentials with the review team via the "Notes to Adobe reviewers" section. Sharing test credentials while submitting the listing will help us expedite the review process.

#### Share a License

Some plugins require users to enter a license key before use. If the same is to be done for your plugin and FastSpring is used to handle your payments, you should share 100 license keys with the review team via the "Notes to Adobe reviewers" section and we will store the license keys on FastSpring. FastSpring will distribute the license key to users who have successfully purchased your plugin.

You will be contacted by asupport@adobe.com to provide an additional license to be restored on FastSpring before the current license expires so users can obtain a license key after purchase.

**Note:** The number of licenses you want to store on FastSpring is up to you, the developer. In general, we encourage developers to share at least 100 licenses, although you are free to share fewer or more license keys if you wish to do so.

#### Provide Proper Installation Instructions

Make sure to provide proper installation instructions under the "Where to find" section, like what files users need to install, or where to place the files. If the plugin supports multiple Adobe products and the instructions are not the same for each product, then the developer must provide the installation instruction for each point product individually. For example, if the installation instructions are different for Photoshop versus InDesign, please include the instructions for both products.

Follow the Adobe Brand Guidelines: Before you use any Adobe brand asset, (for example, product icons) you are required to read the Adobe Brand Guidelines and adhere to them. Without obtaining proper authorization from Adobe, you should never use an asset in your listing or for any marketing purposes. Use of Adobe assets without prior approval will result in rejection.

#### Provide Support

You must make sure that users can always reach out to you and inform you of problems with your plugin. In many cases, we have seen that users give poor reviews and ratings to plugins due to a lack of communication.

#### Additional Payment

If any kind of additional payment is needed to use your plugin, then you must share all the information about it with the user, and you must write about it in the plugin description.

#### Companion application

If any kind of additional application is required for your plugin to work then information about this must be mentioned in the plugin description and you should specify where the user can download the companion application.
