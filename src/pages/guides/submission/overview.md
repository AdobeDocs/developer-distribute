# Submission and Review

Congratulations! You've built a great plugin and you're ready to release it to your customers.

To publish on our Marketplaces, your plugin must first go through a review process.
By reviewing every plugin, Adobe aims to help developers get ready for prime time and ensure that users have great experiences with the plugins they consume. Our goal is to balance providing you with the best developer experience during the review process as possible, while also ensuring the approved plugins offer a great user experience for our mutual customers.

This set of guides is meant to provide you with an idea of what types of information you will need for the submission process and how to best prepare for review. Working through the guides provided in this section will help you make sure you’ve accounted for all of the requirements so you can avoid having to fix things and resubmit before being published.
