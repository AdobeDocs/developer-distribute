# Submission and Review

Congratulations! You've built a great plugin and you're ready to release it to your customers.

To publish on our Marketplaces,â€¯your plugin must first go through a review process.
By reviewing every plugin, Adobe aims to help developers get ready for prime time and ensure that users have great experiences with the plugins they consume. Our goal is to balance providing you with the best developer experience during the review process as possible, while also ensuring the approved plugins offer a great user experience for our mutual customers.

This set of guides is meant to provide you with an idea of what types of information you will need for the submission process and how to best prepare for review. Working through the guides provided in this section will help you make sure youâ€™ve accounted for all of the requirements so you can avoid having to fix things and resubmit before being published.

## Submission Data Requirements

Below is the list of data you will be asked to provide during the submission process.

## Publisher profile

Your publisher profile is about you as a company or developer as whole. Once you've submitted this information and it has been approved by Adobe, it is shown for all plugins and integrations you publish with Adobe.

Go to **Account and profile** > **Public profile**.

Your publisher profile includes required details like:

1. Your publisher public name (often company name or, for individuals, your own name).
2. Your publisher marketing website (again, because this is part of the publisher profile, this website shows for all things you publish with Adobe and should be scoped to you as the publisher, not scoped to any single plugin or integration you submit).
3. A description of you, the publisher.
4. Your logo
5. Trader details. In accordance with the [European Union Digital Services Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32022R2065) trader requirements, developers who wish to distribute their listings in the EU must provide additional information in their publisher profile.

Developer/Trader

The terms **developers/traders** are used interchangeably in this guide.

Any developer who wishes to distribute their listings in the EU can be identified as a trader.

Checkout the [Adobe Know your trader](https://developer.adobe.com/compliance/) guide to understand **why and by when** you must provide these details to make your listings available in the EU.

### Trader details ðŸŒŸ

Choose **Yes** if you wish to make your listings available in Adobe Exchange Marketplace for users in the European Union.

You must provide the following details:

- Business email address
- Country code and Business telephone number
- Business street address or P.O. box
- City
- State/Province/Region
- ZIP/Postal code
- Country
- Business D-U-N-S number [`optional`]

You must complete and submit your publisher profile in order to submit your first plugin, however this is only a one time thing, unless you decide you need to update for your own reasons.

Click **Submit for Review** once you have added the information.

Are you an existing developer?

Existing developers can easily update their trader details directly in their publisher profile through [Adobe Developer Distribution](https://developer.adobe.com/distribute/accountProfile).

Note that only trader details can be added; other fields cannot be edited by developers. For any other changes, write to ccintrev@adobe.com.

You must provide trader details by February 16, 2025, to keep your plugin visible and available for users in the European Union as of February 17, 2025. This trader information will be displayed publicly on your listing detail pages when viewed from EU countries.

Need any corrections in your publisher profile?

You have one opportunity to update and submit your [publisher profile](https://developer.adobe.com/distribute/accountProfile). If you need to make changes after it is approved, contact ccintrev@adobe.com for a second opportunity to update your profile.
