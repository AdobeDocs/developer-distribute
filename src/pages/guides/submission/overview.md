# Top Rejection Reasons

During the review process, plugins are reviewed with the goal of making sure users have positive experiences with the plugins they install, and thus sometimes plugins need to be rejected. This is most often seen when a developer submits a plugin for the first time. If a plugin is rejected, certain changes are requested to be made before they can be re-submitted for review.

## Non-compliance with Adobe Branding Guidelines

Developers often use Adobe brand assets without getting prior permission, (for example, Adobe's "A" icon). This violates the [Adobe Branding Guidelines](https://partners.adobe.com/content/dam/tep_assets/public/public_1/documents/Adobe-Creative-Cloud-Developer-Brand-Guide.pdf). It is advised that before you start using the Adobe assets, please get permission from the Adobe Branding Team by contacting them at [brand@adobe.com](mailto:brand@adobe.com). Once the permissions are granted you can start using Adobe assets on your website and in your screenshots.

## Plugin does not function as described by the developer

- At the time of testing, the review team validates all of the functionality of your plugin. Please make sure before submission that your plugin is functioning as advertised, and all the features are working properly.

- Silent failures: If the plugin user attempts an unsupported function, the plugin must not fail silently. Plugins must display a dialog that this action/functionality is not supported so that users understand it and avoid repeating the same action.

- Your plugin is compatible with all of the Adobe products, product versions, and operating systems you listed in the "Product Compatibility Information" section of your listing.

## Insufficient installation instructions

- Sometimes the installation instructions provided with the submission are not descriptive enough to help a user find the plugin and install it for each of the Adobe applications this product supports.

  **Please note:** Each version of an Adobe application your product supports should have a unique set of instructions listed in the "Where to find it" section of the listing.

- If the review team cannot find the files mentioned in the "Where to find it" section of your listing, your plugin will be rejected. Please supply the path where users would find this plugin from within the Adobe product.
