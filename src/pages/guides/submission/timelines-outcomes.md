# Timelines and Outcomes

We aim to respond to all submissions within 10 business days, but we are typically much faster on average.

Ultimately, your submission will either be approved or rejected. In some cases, we may reach out to you with questions before we send you the outcome of the review.

If your submission is rejected, we will provide the reasons and you are welcome to ask for clarifications. Once you have addressed the reasons for rejection in your listing information, plugin, and/or associated content, you are welcome to resubmit.

Again, our goal is to provide you the best developer experience during review that we can, while helping ensure that approved plugins and integrations offer a great user experience for our mutual customers.
